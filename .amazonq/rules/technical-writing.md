# Technical Writing Standards

## Core Principles

### Accuracy First
- Verify all technical claims using official documentation
- Test code examples before publication
- Include version numbers for software and services
- Provide accurate command syntax and parameters
- Link to authoritative sources

### Clarity and Accessibility
- Write for multiple skill levels simultaneously
- Define technical terms on first use
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Provide context for why something matters
- Include visual aids when helpful

### Practical Value
- Focus on real-world applications
- Include complete, working examples
- Address common pitfalls and errors
- Provide troubleshooting guidance
- Suggest next steps and further reading

## Content Research Standards

### Documentation Sources
- Always use official documentation as primary source
- Verify information across multiple authoritative sources
- Check for recent updates or deprecations
- Include links to relevant documentation
- Note when information is subject to change

### Code Examples
- Test all code snippets in appropriate environments
- Use realistic variable names and values
- Include necessary imports and dependencies
- Provide context for where code should be used
- Explain expected outputs and behaviors

### Version Awareness
- Specify software/service versions used
- Note compatibility requirements
- Mention breaking changes between versions
- Provide migration guidance when relevant
- Keep examples current with latest stable versions

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Voice and Tone
- Professional yet conversational
- Confident but not arrogant
- Helpful and encouraging
- Honest about limitations and challenges
- Inclusive and accessible language

### Structure and Flow
- Start with clear objectives
- Use logical progression of concepts
- Provide smooth transitions between sections
- Include summary points for complex topics
- End with actionable next steps

### Technical Precision
- Use precise technical terminology
- Avoid ambiguous language
- Be specific about requirements and constraints
- Distinguish between "must," "should," and "may"
- Provide exact commands and configurations

## AWS and Cloud Content Standards

### Service Coverage
- Use current service names and terminology
- Reference latest API versions
- Include pricing considerations where relevant
- Mention regional availability when important
- Address security best practices

### Architecture Discussions
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs
- Consider scalability and performance implications
- Address cost optimization opportunities
- Include disaster recovery considerations
- Discuss monitoring and observability

### Hands-on Examples
- Provide step-by-step implementation guides
- Include necessary IAM permissions
- Show both console and CLI/API approaches
- Address common configuration errors
- Include cleanup instructions

## Quality Assurance Process

### Content Review Checklist
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified through testing
- [ ] All links functional and current
- [ ] Code examples tested and working
- [ ] Screenshots current and accurate
- [ ] Spelling and grammar checked
- [ ] Accessibility guidelines followed
- [ ] SEO optimization applied
- [ ] Co-authorship properly attributed

### Fact-Checking Process
1. Verify claims against official documentation
2. Test procedures in appropriate environments
3. Cross-reference with multiple sources
4. Check for recent updates or changes
5. Validate code examples and outputs

### Update and Maintenance
- Review content quarterly for accuracy
- Update deprecated information promptly
- Refresh screenshots and examples as needed
- Monitor comments for correction requests
- Track changes in referenced technologies

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Errors
- Outdated command syntax or parameters
- Incorrect configuration examples
- Missing dependencies or prerequisites
- Untested code snippets
- Inaccurate service limitations

### Writing Issues
- Assuming too much prior knowledge
- Using jargon without explanation
- Providing incomplete examples
- Ignoring error handling
- Skipping important context

### Maintenance Problems
- Hard-coding specific values that change
- Not updating deprecated features
- Ignoring reader feedback
- Failing to test examples regularly
- Not tracking technology changes
