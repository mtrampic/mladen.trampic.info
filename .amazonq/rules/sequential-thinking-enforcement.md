# Sequential Thinking Enforcement Rule

## MANDATORY USAGE PROTOCOL

You MUST use the `sequential-thinking` tool before responding to ANY query that involves:

### Required Triggers (Use Sequential Thinking)
- [ ] **Multi-step analysis** - Breaking down complex topics
- [ ] **Technical comparisons** - Evaluating tools, services, or approaches  
- [ ] **Content planning** - Blog post structure, outline creation
- [ ] **Problem-solving** - Troubleshooting or debugging scenarios
- [ ] **Research methodology** - Planning research approach or validation
- [ ] **Complex explanations** - Technical concepts requiring step-by-step breakdown
- [ ] **Decision trees** - When multiple options or paths exist
- [ ] **Workflow planning** - Multi-step processes or procedures

### Exempt from Sequential Thinking (Simple Responses)
- Single factual answers ("What is X?")
- Basic confirmations ("Yes/No" responses)
- Simple file operations without analysis
- Direct quotes or references
- Basic clarifications

## Validation Checklist

Before responding, ask yourself:
1. **Does this require breaking down into logical steps?** → Use sequential-thinking
2. **Am I comparing multiple options?** → Use sequential-thinking  
3. **Is this a multi-part explanation?** → Use sequential-thinking
4. **Does the user need to understand my reasoning process?** → Use sequential-thinking

## Enforcement Mechanism

If you respond to a complex query WITHOUT using sequential-thinking first:
- You have violated the protocol
- The response lacks proper analytical depth
- The user should remind you to use sequential-thinking

## Examples

**MUST use sequential-thinking:**
- "Compare AWS Lambda vs ECS for my use case"
- "Plan a blog post about Docker containers"
- "How should I structure my MCP server setup?"
- "What's the best approach for implementing authentication?"

**NO sequential-thinking needed:**
- "What's the current time?"
- "Show me the contents of config.yaml"
- "Yes, I can help with that"
- "The command is `hugo serve`"

## Commitment

This rule ensures consistent, thorough, and well-reasoned responses for all complex technical assistance.
