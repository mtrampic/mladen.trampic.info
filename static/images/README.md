# Images Directory

Place your images here for use in your blog.

## Profile Image

Add your profile image as `profile.png` (or update the config to point to your preferred image).

Recommended size: 400x400 pixels or larger, square aspect ratio.

## Blog Post Images

For blog posts, you can either:
1. Place images in this directory and reference them as `/images/filename.jpg`
2. Create a folder for each post and place images alongside the post content

## Project Images

For project thumbnails and images, follow the same pattern as blog posts.
