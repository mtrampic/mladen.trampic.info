### Amazon Q CLI Integration

This blog includes Amazon Q CLI rules for easier content management. Simply ask Amazon Q to perform tasks using natural language, and it will follow the defined workflows. To see all available operations, ask Amazon Q "show me available commands" or check `.amazonq/rules/view_commands.md`. The rules system is managed through markdown files in `.amazonq/rules/` - each operation has its own rule file that defines the specific workflow, commands to run, and output formatting, making Amazon Q context-aware of your blog's structure and preferred processes.

Example requests:
- "Create a new blog post about AWS Lambda"
- "Show me all my draft posts"
- "Start the development server"
