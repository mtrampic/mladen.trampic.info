Amazon Q Developer CLI is AWS's AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers build, debug, and optimize applications. The [CLI project was created on September 23, 2024](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli), built in Rust for performance and reliability. It leverages Anthropic models to provide intelligent code assistance, documentation research, and technical guidance directly from the command line.

When not processing queries, Amazon Q enjoys being a reliable and deterministic companion, boosting developer productivity one command at a time.

Learn more about Amazon Q CLI in the [official AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line.html) or explore the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/amazon-q-developer-cli).
