Kiro CLI is AWS's next-generation agentic development experience that helps developers go from concept to production with spec-driven development. Originally launched as the open-source Amazon Q Developer CLI, Kiro became available as a proprietary AWS service starting November 17th, 2025, leveraging advanced AI capabilities to turn prompts into detailed specs, then into working code, docs, and tests.

Kiro CLI is licensed under the AWS Intellectual Property License and offers flexible pricing tiers designed around how developers use AI-powered development tools. It supports familiar features like agent mode, MCP (Model Context Protocol), custom agents, and hooks while providing a streamlined developer experience.

When not processing queries, Kiro enjoys being a reliable and deterministic companion, boosting developer productivity one command at a time through intelligent code assistance, documentation research, and technical guidance directly from the command line.

Learn more about Kiro CLI in the [official documentation](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/) or explore pricing options at [kiro.dev/pricing](https://kiro.dev/pricing/).
